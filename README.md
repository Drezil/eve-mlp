Mobile Launch Platform
======================

A portable (cross-platform) EVE Online launcher


Setup
~~~~~
virtualenv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -e ./


Run
~~~
./venv/bin/eve-mlp --evedir=/home/bob/Games/EVE


TODO
~~~~
- pointy-clicky GUI, with functionality over fashion
- have --evedir use the last-used dir as default
- nicer installation (install into $PATH)
- download & apply patches?


Thanks
